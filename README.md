# To Run
⚠️ It works, but if you want to use it
- load script in fusion
- edit
    - `f = Form(0.13, 17, 112)` where `m=0.13 pinionToothCount=17 wheelToothCount=112`
    - save
- run

# Notes
- code is slow to generate
- Im gonna leave this as is, as Ive moved to developing https://github.com/fzuleta/fusion-360-cycloidal-gears-nihs which is `NIHS 20-01 NIHS 20-02 NIHS 20-10`
- Needs arcs in the tooth, easy to do, if you feel like improving this ❤️
